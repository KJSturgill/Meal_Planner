# Meal_Planner
I am attempting to make a app to easily sort through a database of any meal I can cook, because I forget everything I have ever eaten when I go to decide what to eat for dinner. So this project is a simple way to sort through the different meals I like. For now it is just set up with options my fiance and I generally eat, tho one day I may update it to be on a database thats easier to rewrite and add options. You start by choosing a genre of food. then youre given options for the main protien (or vegitarian). once you chooose a protien, it lists each meal in that genre that works with the protien. if you choose a meal it will give the ingredients list to be able to go buy everything you need. Not including the recipe yet as I know the recipes and it will save on lines of code until I make a database or impliment APIs.

here are the Features used on the project requirements:
Implement a “master loop” console application where the user can repeatedly enter commands/perform actions, including choosing to exit the program.
Create an additional class which inherits one or more properties from its parent (2 classes inherit from a parent class)
Create a dictionary or list, populate it with several values, retrieve at least one value, and use it in your program (I have multiple populated lists, and retrieve values from them)
Use a LINQ query to retrieve information from a data structure such as a list or array or file (this is how i retrieve the values from said lists)

SPECIAL INSTRUCTIONS:
For now, all input will be numbers (specifically whole numbers to be int)
the program will lopp until (0) is entered when asked, any other key pressed when (0) is presented as an option, will loop the program


(I will update this readme as I make progress on this app)

Okay, so I had some trouble making it the way I had initially set out to do. since this is for a class project, I set out to meet the requirements first,and I will come back and improve upon it as I get better at coding. For now, it is in a console app command window. I have created lists, and use LINQ queries to narrow down options. The code id far longer thatn it needs to be, but again I settled for functional for the class project deadline, and will make improvements later on. I will not abandon this project as It has potential to help me, and intend to one day have an application with a user interface.

If anyone actually comes across this and is interested in making it work for themselves, reach out to me and ill explain my code.
