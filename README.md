# Meal_Planner
I am attempting to make a app to easily sort through a database of any meal I can cook, because I forget everything I have ever eaten when I go to decide what to eat for dinner. 

(I will update this readme as I make progress on this app)

Okay, so I had some trouble making it the way I had initially set out to do. since this is for a class project, I set out to meet the requirements first,and I will come back and improve upon it as I get better at coding. For now, it is in a console app command window. I have created lists, and use LINQ queries to narrow down options. The code id far longer thatn it needs to be, but again I settled for functional for the class project deadline, and will make improvements later on. I will not abandon this project as It has potential to help me, and intend to one day have an application with a user interface.

If anyone actually comes across this and is interested in making it work for themselves, reach out to me and ill explain my code.
